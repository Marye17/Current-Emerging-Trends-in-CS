Marye Bierbaum, Current/Emerging Trends in CS

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
For Project Two we were given code that established the game's environment and tabulates all the data the agent collects while moving through the game.
I built the Q-Training algorthm, which takes that data and determines the best next move.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists build and analyze computer systems, including both hardware and software. As technology becomes an increasing large part of our lives, so does the importance of computer science, which aims to create solutions that make our lives easier in a way that is fair and thoughtful.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
Analytically, looking from a place of learning to fully understand the issue and its causes. Then I would use sound data and computer science to design and test a solution. 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
Computer scientists have an ethical responsibiity to ensure the solutions they implement are free of bias and do no harm.
